My Hubby as always for being so patient with me during this learning time! 


## Installation:

I wanna say to just put npm install in your terminal because that seems like a recurring thing in these last assignments.

node server.js

Then click on the get started button

Then create a new note or read a previous note.

You can also delete notes that you dont need anymore.
